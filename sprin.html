    <p>Spin-transport electronics, or Spintronics, a new evolving technology, is based on spin of electrons 
      and its associated magnetic moments along with electric charge for next generation nano-electronic devices. 
      Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), a core device in this field have evolved immensely and is used being utilized 
      in applications like MRAM, read head and hard disk drive.</p>
    <p>Our group here is involved in designing various 2D materials and their computational investigation for magnetic 
      tunnel junctions. We also study the transport phenomena of 2D materials based magnetic tunnel junctions.</p>
