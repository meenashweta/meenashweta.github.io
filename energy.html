      Energy storage is an encouraging way to relieve the increasing environment and energy crises. However, 
      it is challenging to implement its broad application owing to unsatisfactory electrode materials. 2D 
      materials are potential candidates due to their unique physicochemical properties and geometry. There 
       PhD. and graduate researchers who are working with Dr. Shweta at Computational & Molecular Engineering 
       Lab for engineering 2D material like MXene and graphene and their heterostructures for promoting charge 
       transport capability and achieving high storage capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our team aims at investigating first-principles DFT computations of these 2D materials and their 
      heterostructures for ion batteries and hydrogen storage
