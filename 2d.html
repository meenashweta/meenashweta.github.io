    <p>Since 2D materials have excellent surface to volume ratios, their properties are greatly
      motivated by surface functionalization and local environment. Subsequently, molecular engineering
       hold potential promise in expanding the applications and properties of 2D material. In this
      research project, our group aims in exploring various ways of engineering properties of 2D 
      materials like chemical functionalization, heteroatom adsorption and designing heterostructures
       For instance, in one of our studies we have engineered the band gap of graphene and CNTs
      by surface functionalization by fluorine. In another study, we have investigated the impact of 
      efects like bending and twisting of graphene on its spin transport properties. The group also aims
       to study heterostructures of different 2D materials like MXenes and graphene in energy storage 
      aplications for enhancing storage capacity and charging rates of ion batteries. </p>
